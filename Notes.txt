ecap: Class 1

What is testNG.
Testng is a tool we use to automate applications.

why do we need it?
reports
parallel execution
annotation based execution
grouping
data driven testing
multiple options for execution


@Test annotation - this is the main annotation of testng to execute our TC

it executes test cases in alphabetical order by default

@before method as a precondition that executes before every tc
@after method as a postcondition that executes after every tc

Class 2 -
User story 12345 - Admin user should be able to login with valid credentials

User story 22345 - Verify the title of the application

Priority - by default it is set to 0
to prioritize the test cases, we use this attribute

enable and disable - to make any test case enabled or disabled temporarily we use  this attribute


Assertions:
Hard Assertions - Assertions we use for small execution because it stops execution if encounters error
Soft assertions - Assertions we use to execute complete code with multiple check points and in the end we use assertall method
to get the collective failure of test case

mac users - option cmd L
windows users - clt alt L


Testng.xml where highest level is suite --> test --> packages --> class --> methods (@Test)

groups - we use different groups to separate the test cases

alwaysrun = true - we use this attribute to execute the pre and post condition from testng.xml file

class 3 -

Recap -
@before class and @after class -
it executes before every class and after every class

priority - we use this attribute to prioritize our test cases

enable and disable - to make any test case disabled or enabled, we use this attribute

Assertions: we use assertions for verification and validation
Hard assertion - the moment it identifies an error, it stops execution
Soft assertion - it collects all the failures till the end and allows our complete code to execute
we use assertAll method to get the collective failure from it.

dependson - to mention the name of depending test case in dependent test case, we use this attribute


testng.xml file -

to execute all the test cases or some of the test case in a single shot.
Batch execution is possible due to testng.xml file

package wise
method wise
class wise
group wise

smoke - checking the key functionality of the application- quick testing
regression - checking the fixed module and other module as well is regression testing



Data provider - it returns 2D array which we use to perform data driven testing

listener - listen all the events and provide us the details of execution according to the instructions provided
